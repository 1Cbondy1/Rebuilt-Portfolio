                        <p> From a young age, I’ve had a profound interest in media, technology, and the point at which they converge. At Louisiana State University's School of Architecture, I was conditioned to work in an intense, creative, and collaborative studio environment. There I developed the standard architectural concepts and technical standards. By the time I graduated, I was ready to tackle the world with my archival ink and T-square, one piece of trace paper at a time.</p>
                        <p>For the first few years after graduation, I practiced scenic design for broadcast television and branded environments in New York City. However, I quickly felt the pull towards a career in an emerging and faster-paced industry.</p>
                        <p>I moved back to Austin and am currently enrolled in The Coding Bootcamp at UT for web development. After completion the program, I hope to use the technical knowledge I've gained to build a career in UX/UI design.</p>
