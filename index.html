                            <p> I’ve always had a strong interest in design and technology. These interests are what drew me to LSU's School of Architecture, where I was conditioned to work in an intense, collaborative studio environment. It’s also where I picked up my first coding chops through a minor in digital media arts. I took the concepts I learned into practice, as a scenic designer for broadcast television in New York City. After working for a few years, I felt the pull towards a career in an emerging and faster-paced industry.</p><br>
                            <p> I moved back to Austin and enrolled in The Coding Bootcamp UT. The content of the course was instantly fascinating to me. The Adobe Creative Suite tools that I had used for years could now be supplemented with JavaScript, React, and other technologies to add functionality to static designs. I hope to use the technical knowledge I've gained along with my background in design build a career in UX/UI development.</p>
